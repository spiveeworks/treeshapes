looking at spectra generated for trees of size 4 and 5 confirmed the result
that spectral matrices are upper triangular, and that diagonals are the
negative of the size of the subtree corresponding to that node

the determinants seem to measure how balanced the trees are, from maximally
balanced: (expr?), to maximally unbalanced: n!


However since the matrices are triangular, it does look like the determinants
coincide at 8 leaves
another permutation-independant measure is the trace, which coincides at 6
leaves.

This discussion splits two ways, first is the fact that the trace does depend
on how eigenvectors are associated with basis matrices, changing the relation
creates different trace values.
second is the fact that the trace and the determinant are symmetric functions
of the diagonal, i.e. of the eigenvalues _of the spectral matrix_.

It turns out that there is a pair of trees with 9 leaves that have their whole
diagonal the same! (modulo ordering)
this means that any function which is symmetric (and hence doesn't depend on
relabelling) will be non-injective as well.

On the other hand the matrix as a whole appears to be injective, so it is worth
asking how much could be removed from the matrix without breaking injectivity.
Could you reconstruct the tree from an ordered spectrum?
