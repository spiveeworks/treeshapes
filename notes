eig matrix
----------

For an n leaf tree, we have dim(A)=n-1 for the tree algebra.

Let s(L_i)  be the ith (ordered/include multiplicity) spectrum of the basis matrix L_i. So s(L_i) is an n-vector.

Each L_i has a 0 as an eigenvalue corresponding to the col vector of all 1s. Remove this from the spectrum vectors.

Thus we have (n-1) (n-1)-vectors.

Form a square matrix out of these and take the absolute value of its determinant.

Then this value will only depend on the tree shape, since the determinant simply acquires +/- under permutation of rows/columns.

(Geometrically we can consider this to be the volume spanned by the spectrum vectors.)



basis variance
--------------

if detsubst(L*) = the determinant as described, but with respect to basis L*, L_2, L_3... L_n-1, so that detsubst(L_1) is exactly the determinant as described

then detsubst(L_1 + L_2) expanded on the first column seems to give the same expression as detsubst(L_1) + detsubst(L_2) expanded on their first columns

but detsubst(L_2) is the determinant of a singular matrix [spec(L_2), spec(L_2), spec(L_3)...], so equals zero

the same doesn't seem to apply to detsubst(L_1 + L_1) though, so we might need to normalize the L_i matrices somehow?



degenerecy and eig matrix
-------------------------

If two subtrees of the tree have the same spectrum (e.g. if they are the same)
then the matrix will have a repeated row, and hence will not be invertible, and
hence will have a determinent of zero, however this is specifically the case
where the vector space generated by the spectra is no longer trivial.



symmetry and degeneracy
-----------------------

when taking the span or determinent of the spectrum vectors, we see that
repeated spectra give a trivial span of C^(n-1), and a determinent of 0

As such we care about whether a tree has degeneracy or not, and it would seem
that a tree with symmetry would be degenerate, e.g.:

   ^
  / \
 ^   ^
1 2 3 4

it looks like the 2nd and 3rd internal node have the same spectrum, being
relabellings of eachother, but in fact they do not, since we are looking at the
spectra generated by _a fixed sequence of eigenvectors_, and hence relabelling
the leaves results in the eigenvectors being permuted, which is undone only by
permuting the eigenvalues, giving a different spectrum.

A = PBP', B = VLV'
A = (PV)L(PV)'
so A v_p(i) = l_i v_p(i)



entropy and computation
-----------------------

The matrix representations simply correspond {i_l} x {i_r}
the leaf descendents of the left child of the node,
multiplied by the leaf descendents of the right child of the node
if we consider these matrices invariant under relabelling (which they aren't
quite) then it looks like this is just representing the size of each child
tree, and we could canonicalize as such:

any subtree's matrix is similar by permutation to a matrix of the form:
m_ij = -2*x if i = j <= x
     = -2*y if i = j > x <= x + y
     = 1 if i <= x, x < j <= x + y
     = 1 if x < i <= x + y, j <= x
     = 0 otherwise

where x is the number of leaves on the left of the subtree's root,
and y is the number of leaves on the right
x + y = n_i <= n

this could be very useful computationally, especially since these matrices can
be extended or retracted by the rows and columns of zero

such an extension simply adds a zero eigenvalue corresponding to
[0, .. 0, 1]
and a zero coordinate to each existing eigenvector without changing the
eigenvalue

this means that each spectrum will only have x + y - 1 non-zero eigenvalues,
so the matrix of eigenvalues will be about half zeroes

in fact for the case of the balanced 4-tree, the nodes and eigenvectors can be
rearranged so that the matrix has the form:
[ a 0 b ]
[ 0 c d ]
[ 0 0 e ]

which will clearly have a determinant of a*c*e

it is not at all clear whether these upper triangular forms exist for all
trees, since the eigenvectors don't clearly correspond to leaves of the tree,
(if they did we might want to order the trees from smallest to largest, or
order the leaves of the tree by the number of subtrees they sit inside)
in fact eigenvectors in the null space may be an arbitrary basis of the null
space, however computing the eigenvalue matrices of more trees may provide
insight
