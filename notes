eig matrix
----------

For an n leaf tree, we have dim(A)=n-1 for the tree algebra.

Let s(L_i)  be the ith (ordered/include multiplicity) spectrum of the basis matrix L_i. So s(L_i) is an n-vector.

Each L_i has a 0 as an eigenvalue corresponding to the col vector of all 1s. Remove this from the spectrum vectors.

Thus we have (n-1) (n-1)-vectors.

Form a square matrix out of these and take the absolute value of its determinant.

Then this value will only depend on the tree shape, since the determinant simply acquires +/- under permutation of rows/columns.

(Geometrically we can consider this to be the volume spanned by the spectrum vectors.)



basis variance
--------------

if detsubst(L*) = the determinant as described, but with respect to basis L*, L_2, L_3... L_n-1, so that detsubst(L_1) is exactly the determinant as described

then detsubst(L_1 + L_2) expanded on the first column seems to give the same expression as detsubst(L_1) + detsubst(L_2) expanded on their first columns

but detsubst(L_2) is the determinant of a singular matrix [spec(L_2), spec(L_2), spec(L_3)...], so equals zero

the same doesn't seem to apply to detsubst(L_1 + L_1) though, so we might need to normalize the L_i matrices somehow?



degenerecy and eig matrix
-------------------------

If two subtrees of the tree have the same spectrum (e.g. if they are the same)
then the matrix will have a repeated row, and hence will not be invertible, and
hence will have a determinent of zero, however this is specifically the case
where the vector space generated by the spectra is no longer trivial.



entropy and degeneracy
----------------------

any subtree's matrix is similar by permutation to a matrix of the form:
m_ij = -2*x if i = j <= x
     = -2*y if i = j > n - y
     = 1 if i <= x, j > n - y
     = 1 if i > x, j <= n - y
     = 0 otherwise

where x is the number of leaves on the left of the subtree's root,
and y is the number of leaves on the right
x + y = n_i <= n

this isn't a lot of information, but the algebra actually has a consistent
ordering for its eigenvectors/values, which won't be preserved by this
simplification... even if the subtrees are identical!

this means even trees with similar/identical subtrees won't have repeated
spectra!
it's hard to know if/when they ever will
