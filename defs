Definitions
- binary trees, leaf/branch labelled (map V -> Z)
 - different labellings of trees, leaves, branches
- mrca = most recent common ancestor
- hierarchy idea
- in degree, out degree, root, branch, leaf
- tree shape = equivalence class of labelled trees (group actions)
- V_n = set of trees with n leaves
- S_n, S{n+1, n2-1}, their product both act on V_n
- orbits under this action give three different sets of shapes
- one can be recovered from values, one from vectors, yet to find the last one

- matrix on each vertex
- trivial in leaf nodes
- label internal nodes L_1 .. L_n-1
- matrix on vertex
 - effect of tree shape
  - S_n acts on C^n
- isomorphic under tree relabelling
- if we permute rows we stay in tree classes

eigen stuff, spectra, dets etc


Review
-matsen
 - what has established? key example
- steel chapter
 - measures of tree shape balance etc.
