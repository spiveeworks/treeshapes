definitions:
 - spectrum (as an ordered list)
  - unsorted spectrum? for matsen
 - immanantal polynomial
 - child
 - descendant
  - relationship between ancestry and descendent?
 - ancestry as the unique path from root to vertex
 - [n] = {1..n}
 - symmetric groups
 - supplementing pruned trees
  - (dont actually call it pruned... well maybe do)

terminology:
 - tree with labels, tree with leaf labels, tree without labels
  - no binary
  - no n leaves
  - rephrase the definition "when we say tree with labels we mean a directed
    graph that represents a rooted binary tree with n leaves" type thing
  (i just went with the term id defined as both a literal description and as
  not so convenient term for use within the paper)
 - operation
  - no measurements, representations, statistics, etc.
 - covariant
  - less qualifiers... no more "up to isomorphism", "under leaf labelling"
  - find a group action in the image that commutes with the domain
  - do the leaf and internal relabellings at the same time, one might be
    trivial
  - shows that the operation is well defined on the orbits -> orbits
 - invariant
  - covariant with singleton orbits
  - obviously shows orbits -> elements
 - distinguishes
  - recover some kind of relation
   - hierarchy for leaf labels
   - partial order of internal verteces for branch labels
   - partial order of all verteces for both (cleanly separable tho)
   - or proof that hierarchy labels match up to branch labels
   - proof that each of these actually works...
 - internal vertices, leaves
  - branches are edges... branch points are vertices

examples of things
 - trivial example for each named property
  - including one for the converse of a property
 - examples of other useful phenomena like my existing 9-trees

clarify and rewrite stuff
 - dont be afraid of making the report very very long

boldface definitions
mathcal Ss for symmetric groups.. maybe define `\S`

also actually finish the proofs and things....
 - find the leaf and branch actions that satisfy covariance
 - show that each step in the process can recover descendence/preorder info
  - construct a map to the partial order based on the previous one
  - show that this map will give the same result as undoing one step and going
    back from there?
 - make the simultaneous diag argument more clear
any wips, []s and %s

also generally try to make each annotated mistake in the paper clear enough
that i wouldnt have to justify it in person.. rearrange/reword things so that
the report speaks for itself.
