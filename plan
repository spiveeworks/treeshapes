It seems like the structure ive been suggested boils down to:

3 sections that all:
explain existing terms and discoveries
explain why they matter
explain our goal
explain why it matters

say what i achieved

which has the effect of explaining what i achieved and why it matters


so the actual structure is:

1. whats a binary tree, whats a shape, whats a measurement
2. what did matsen do
3. what are the algebras im interested in, how do we use it
4. what did i find out

but i think that the end is the most important thing, everything else should be
instrumental to that

so first im going to write what i found out:

the basis can be used to reconstruct the tree
the basis is essentially just 2 rectangles of 1s
there is an eigenvector corresponding to each vertex
eigenvalues correspond to the side of the subtree the eigenvector corresponds
  to
the eigenvalues can be arranged to be upper triangular
the eigenvectors are orthogonal
the eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be used to reconstruct the tree
 - nice link back to first discovery hey!

i think ill blindly just prepare this section of the presentation and work
backwards once its been prepared.
